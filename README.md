# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Classifier
Objective: Train a machine learning model to recognize rock, paper, and scissors hand gestures using Teachable Machine.


Materials:
•	Computer with a webcam
•	Internet access
•	Teachable Machine account (free)

Procedure:
a.	Create a New Project:

a.	Open Teachable Machine and create a new project.
b.	Choose the "Image Project" option.


b.	Define Classes:

a.	Add three classes: "Rock," "Paper," and "Scissors."

 
c.	Collect Data:

a.	Use your webcam to capture images of yourself making each gesture.
b.	For each class, collect at least 20-30 images from different angles and lighting conditions.
c.	Ensure clear, well-lit images with distinct hand gestures.

 
d.	Train the Model:

a.	Click the "Train Model" button.
b.	Teachable Machine will process the images and train the model.


e.	Test the Model:

a.	Use the webcam to test the model's accuracy.
b.	Make different hand gestures and observe the model's predictions.
c.	If the model makes incorrect predictions, collect more data for those classes.
 
 
f.	Export the Model:

a.	Once you're satisfied with the model's accuracy, export it as a TensorFlow.js model.
g.	Integrate into a Web Application:
a.	Use the exported model to create a web application that can recognize hand gestures in real-time.
b.	You can use frameworks like p5.js or TensorFlow.js to implement this.
